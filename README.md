# Python Learning — Start Here

This folder is set up so you can learn Python from zero. No coding experience needed.

## Quick start

### 1. Open the project in Cursor (or any editor)

You’re already here.

### 2. Activate the virtual environment (recommended)

In a terminal, from this folder:

**On Mac/Linux:**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

**On Windows:**
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

When it’s active, you’ll see `(venv)` at the start of your terminal line.

### 3. Follow the learning guide

Open **LEARNING.md** and go through the lessons in order. Each section has small examples you can type and run.

### 4. Run a Python file

**Easiest:** Open `hello.py`, then click the **▶ Run** button (top right). Output appears in the Terminal panel.

**From terminal:** Use `python3` on Mac (often `python` is not installed):

```bash
python3 hello.py
```

If you activated the venv (step 2), you can use `python hello.py` instead.

**See all options:** Open **HOW_TO_RUN_CODE.md** for the full guide (Run button, terminal, interactive mode).
